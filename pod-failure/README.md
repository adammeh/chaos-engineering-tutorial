In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
1. Design a small chaos experiment in Kubernetes.
2. Inject pod-level failures in a controlled way.
3. Observe how the system behaves under failure.
4. Compare recovery with single vs multiple pod replicas.
5. Understand how Kubernetes self-healing contributes to reliability in DevOps.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
1. Explain the purpose of chaos engineering and why it matters in DevOps.
2. Describe the roles of Pods, Deployments, and Services in Kubernetes.
3. Interpret the behavior of a system under controlled Pod failure.
