# Chaos Engineering - Pod-failure Experiment

## Introduction

Q. What is chaos engineering?
A. It's a way of testing the resilience of a system by intentionally injecting failures.

Q. Why is chaos engineering useful?
A. It identifies and addresses potential vulnerabilities through controlled experiments. This helps to improve and build resilient systems.

Kubernetes promises built-in resilience. This tutorial will demonstrate how to design, run, and analyze controlled failure experiments, specifically pod-failure experiments in Kubernetes.

### Learning Objectives

1. Design a small chaos experiment.
2. Run controlled failure injections (randomized pod deletion) in Kubernetes.
3. Observe and measure recovery.
4. ...

### Prerequisites

- Basic Kubernetes knowledge
- Understanding of Pods, Deployments, and other basic concepts
