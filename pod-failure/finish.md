# Tutorial Complete!

Congratulations! You’ve successfully completed the Pod Failure Chaos tutorial in Kubernetes.

## Key Learnings

- Chaos Engineering is about proactively testing resilience, not waiting for outages.
- A Pod Delete experiment validates Kubernetes’ self-healing and load-balancing mechanisms.
- Running with multiple replicas prevents downtime from single pod failures.
- These practices strengthen confidence in automated deployments and production reliability.

## Further Learning

- Try chaos experiments for network latency, CPU/memory stress, or node failures.
- Explore dedicated chaos frameworks like LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh.
- Consider integrating chaos experiments into your CI/CD pipeline to continuously validate resilience.

Thank you for completing this tutorial!
